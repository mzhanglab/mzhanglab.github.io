<p><strong>We are looking for postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, and research interns</strong> <a href="http://localhost:4000/openings">(see openings)</a> <strong>!</strong></p>

<p>We design statistically principled methods, develop user-friendly software, and study the genetic basis of human diseases. 
We currently focus on integrative analysis of genetics and functional genomics data.
Topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Identifying disease-critical cellular contexts through integrating GWAS and functional genomics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding the genetic architecture of human diseases and the underlying evolutionary driving forces through analyzing biobank-scale genetics data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding the causal relationship between genes and disease through analyzing GWAS, eQTL, and perturbation data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also develop general statistical and machine learning algorithms motivated by applications in genetics; topics include multiple hypotheses testing, multi-armed bandits, dimensionality reduction, empirical Bayes, and causal inference.</p>

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology.
