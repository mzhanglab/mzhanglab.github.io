    <h4>PhD students</h4>

    <p>The Zhang Lab is seeking two highly-motivated PhD students. 
The students will work with Dr. Martin Zhang on problems in statistical genetics and machine learning, involving algorithm design (occasionally proving theorems), software implementation, and studying problems in statistical and/or evolutionary genetics. 
The students will have the flexibility to choose their projects or propose new projects, broadly aligning with <a href="http://localhost:4000/research">the labâ€™s research directions</a>. 
Dr. Zhang will provide hands-on guidance in conducting research and writing papers, as well as ample opportunities for collaboration (within and outside CMU) and presenting research works.</p>

    <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently admitted to a CMU PhD program.</li>
      <li>Strong skills in algorithm design, mathematical modeling, and programming (e.g., Python or R).</li>
      <li>(Preferred but not required) Experience in analyzing genetics and genomics data, such as GWAS and scRNA-seq</li>

    <h4>Rotation students and research interns</h4>

    <p>The Zhang lab is seeking several rotation students and research interns at different levels: PhD/master/undergraduate, within/outside CMU, and in-person/remote. 
The students will work with Dr. Martin Zhang on problems in statistical genetics and machine learning. 
Compared to PhD students, rotation students and research interns are expected to work on smaller projects with a shorter
