    <h4>PhD students</h4>

    <p>The Zhang Lab is seeking two highly-motivated PhD students. 
The students will work with Dr. Martin Zhang on problems in statistical genetics and machine learning, involving algorithm design (occasionally proving theorems), software implementation, and studying problems in statistical and/or evolutionary genetics. 
The students will have the flexibility to choose their projects or propose new projects, broadly in line with <a href="http://localhost:4000/research">the lab’s research directions</a>. 
Dr. Zhang will provide hands-on guidance in conducting research and writing papers, as well as ample opportunities for collaboration (within and outside CMU) and presenting research works.</p>

    <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently admitted to a CMU PhD program.</li>
      <li>Strong skills in algorithm design, mathematical modeling, and programming (e.g., Python or R).</li>
      <li>(Preferred but not required) Experience in analyzing genetics and genomics data, such as GWAS and scRNA-seq</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Apply:</strong> contact Dr. Martin Zhang by email with title “Applying for PhD position in the Zhang Lab” and your recent CV.</p>

    <h4>Rotation students and research interns</h4>

    <p>The Zhang lab welcomes rotation students and research interns at all levels: graduate or undergraduate, within or outside CMU, and in-person or remote. 
The students will work with Dr. Martin Zhang on problems in statistical genetics and machine learning. 
The students will have the flexibility to choose their projects or propose new projects, broadly in line with <a href="http://localhost:4000/research">the lab’s research directions</a>. 
The projects are expected to have a smaller scale and a short cycle (e.g., 3-6 months for a conference submission). 
Dr. Zhang will provide hands-on guidance in conducting research and writing papers, as well as ample opportunities for collaboration (within and outside CMU) and presenting research works.</p>

    <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong skills in algorithm design, mathematical modeling, and programming (e.g., Python or R).</li>
      <li>(Preferred but not required) Experience in analyzing genetics and genomics data, such as GWAS and scRNA-seq</li>
    </ul>
